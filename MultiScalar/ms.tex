\maketitle

In Nested Sampling (NS), we want to infer the function $L(X)$.
Knowledge about the NS procedure gives us a prior for a sequence of $X$ values
obtained from the run. We can, of course, measure the corresponding $L$
values, and there is an underlying assumption that measurements of $L$ are
uninformative about $X$ apart from imposing an ordering
(i.e. $L_i > L_j$ implies $X_i < X_j$). This is related to the fact that the
progress of NS is invariant under monotonic transformations of $L$.

Uninformativeness is also a property of probability distributions, which
is more commonly called {\it independence}. If we have a proposition $A$ and
another proposition $B$ and assign independent probabilities, then
$P(A|B) = P(A)$ and $P(B|A) = P(B)$, learning one of $A$ and $B$
does not change our knowledge of the other.
